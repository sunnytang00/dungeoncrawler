Planning: 2/3
- Needs to map dependencies, e.g. alive/die comes after battles
- Good segmentation under units of functionality

Collaborative Engineering: 2/2

Ticket Lifecycle: 5/5
- Design updates team approved and with tickets, well done

Other feedback:
- Protected fields
- Testing plan is a test list, not an explanation of test architecture
- Only had controller level tests
- Use subfolders more for grouping packages
- Some functions are long and messy, this is due to underlying coupling & cohesion problems discussed in the lab
